Welcome to the Bank Account Management website! This website allows you to create bank accounts and perform transactions with ease. Here's how you can use the site:

Create a Bank Account:
Fill out the form on the homepage with the account holder's name, account type, and initial balance. Click the "Create Account" button to create a new bank account.

Perform Transactions:
Once your account is created, the transaction area will be displayed. Here, you can perform various transactions:

Deposit: Enter the amount to deposit and click the "Deposit" button.
Withdraw: Enter the amount to withdraw and click the "Withdraw" button.
Check Balance: Click the "Check Balance" button to see the current balance.
Transfer: Enter the amount to transfer and click the "Transfer" button.
View Transaction Results:
The result area below the transaction area will display the outcome of each transaction, such as success messages or error notifications.

Now, let's dive into how classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements were used in the website's code:

Classes (BankAccount):
In the JavaScript file, a BankAccount class is implemented to encapsulate the logic for bank accounts. This class allows for creating new accounts, performing transactions, and managing balances.

Switch Statements (executeTransaction function):
The executeTransaction function uses a switch statement to handle different transaction types (deposit, withdraw, check balance, transfer). Based on the selected transaction, the function executes the corresponding code block to carry out the transaction.

Try-Catch-Finally Statements (createAccount function):
The createAccount function utilizes a try-catch-finally statement to handle errors during the account creation process. The try block attempts to create a new account, while the catch block catches any errors that may occur. Finally, the finally block executes cleanup code, ensuring that the form is reset regardless of success or failure.

These programming constructs enhance the functionality and robustness of the website by providing structured control flow and error handling capabilities.

In conclusion, the Bank Account Management website allows you to create accounts and perform transactions effortlessly. Through the use of classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements, the website offers a user-friendly experience while ensuring smooth execution and error handling.
